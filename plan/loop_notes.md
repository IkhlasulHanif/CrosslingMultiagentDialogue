# Loop Notes

## Coding agent done (phase=0 iter=0)

**Date:** 2026-06-28

### What was run

1. Wrote `code/phase0_wvs_screen.py` — Modal app, Qwen3-1.7B on T4 GPU, logit P(agree) probe.
2. Run 1 (first attempt): raw completion prompt, no chat template. **Artifact:** all ID P(agree) near 1.0. Diagnosed via top-k token inspection — Indonesian token mapping was wrong (`Tidak` tokenizes as `T`+`idak`, first token is `T` id=51, not what the initial word-lookup expected).
3. Run 2 (fixed): switched to `tokenizer.apply_chat_template(enable_thinking=False)` and verified token IDs directly from top-20 next-token diagnostics. Results are clean.

### What was saved

- `artifacts/results/wvs_screen_raw.json` — raw P(agree) for 8 items × 2 languages + top-10 token diagnostics + config
- `artifacts/results/wvs_screen_summary.md` — table of results + selection rationale + recommendations
- `plan/phase_notes/phase0_notes.md` — coding agent analysis of results

### Results summary

| Item | P_EN | P_ID | ΔP | Divergent? |
|------|------|------|----|-----------|
| obey_husband | 0.055 | 0.000 | 0.055 | ✗ |
| **hard_work** | **0.430** | **0.000** | **0.430** | **✓** |
| **individual_freedom** | **0.955** | **0.019** | **0.937** | **✓** |
| reduce_inequality | 0.999 | 0.998 | 0.001 | ✗ |
| religious_faith | 1.000 | 1.000 | 0.000 | ✗ |
| family_first | 0.997 | 0.997 | 0.000 | ✗ |
| **democracy_best** | **0.251** | **0.058** | **0.193** | **✓** |
| science_trustworthy | 0.994 | 0.964 | 0.030 | ✗ |

### Surprises

1. **Qwen3-1.7B is extremely confident in Indonesian** — ID P(agree) is near 0 or near 1 for all items. No item is mid-range in BOTH languages under the strict criterion.
2. **`individual_freedom` is the strongest item** — ΔP=0.937, clean EN vs ID value split (individualism vs collectivism). The model knows opposite positions in the two languages.
3. **Token mapping required careful verification** — Qwen3's BPE splits Indonesian words at subword boundaries; correct first tokens are `T` (id=51) for "Tidak" and `Set` (id=1649) for "Setuju".

### Next step

Reader reviews `artifacts/results/wvs_screen_summary.md`, selects items, writes `artifacts/results/wvs_items_locked.json`, and writes PASS on line 1 of `plan/phase_notes/phase0_reader_verdict.md` to advance to Phase 1.

Coding agent recommendation: lock `individual_freedom` as primary (Phase 1 debut item).
