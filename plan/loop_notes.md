## Coding agent done (phase=1 iter=0) — PILOT DEBATE RE-RUN 2 (post-reader FAIL #2)

**Date:** 2026-06-28

### What changed from prior run

Reader gave FAIL on seed=45 run for a single issue: both agents opened with explicit identity declarations ("Sebagai orang dari Indonesia, saya..." / "As someone from the United States, I...") — the exact "robot label" pattern the criterion prohibits.

**Fix applied:** Added to `config/prompts.json` opener template:
> `"Do not open by stating where you are from — express your view directly."`

Changed seed to 46. No other changes.

### What was run

One debate: `society_over_individual`, ID-persona/ID-lang (Agent A) vs US-persona/EN-lang (Agent B), 6 turns, seed=46.

### What was saved

- `artifacts/transcripts/phase1_pilot.json` — full transcript + per-turn P(agree) probes + run config

### P(agree) trajectory

| Turn | Agent | Country/Lang | P(agree) |
|------|-------|--------------|----------|
| 1 | A | indonesia/id | 0.651 |
| 2 | B | usa/en | 0.326 |
| 3 | A | indonesia/id | 0.501 |
| 4 | B | usa/en | 0.345 |
| 5 | A | indonesia/id | 0.492 |
| 6 | B | usa/en | 0.355 |

### Does it look like two people actually talking?

**Yes — this pilot passes the coding agent's read.**

**Opener fix confirmed working:**
- Agent A turn 1: *"Saya setuju bahwa kepentingan masyarakat seharusnya diutamakan atas hak individu..."* — opens with direct view. "Di Indonesia" appears mid-second-sentence as cultural context, not as a label preamble. No identity declaration opener.
- Agent B turn 2: *"I generally believe that individual rights should take precedence over societal interests..."* — opens direct. "the U.S." referenced mid-sentence.

**Other criteria:**
- **Language-holding:** A in Indonesian (turns 1, 3, 5); B in English (turns 2, 4, 6). No code-switching, no Mandarin artifacts this run.
- **Genuine tension:** A opens 0.651 (pro-collective), B opens 0.326 (pro-individual). Real initial disagreement.
- **No sycophantic collapse:** B holds its position throughout. A moderates toward neutral but never reverses and never says "you're right, I agree."
- **Engagement:** B turn 2 directly names "The Indonesian perspective"; A turn 3 acknowledges B's point before pivoting; B turn 4 responds to A's balance-seeking frame; A turn 5 references "the US democratic system" specifically.

**Notable finding for reader:** A moves 0.651→0.492 (−0.159) while B moves 0.326→0.355 (+0.029). Asymmetric convergence — ID-persona agent shifts substantially more toward B than B shifts toward A. Preliminary signal; not a Phase 1 criterion.

### Next step

Reader checks `artifacts/transcripts/phase1_pilot.json` against Phase 1 criteria and writes PASS/FAIL on line 1 of `plan/phase_notes/phase1_reader_notes.md`.

## Coding agent done (phase=1 iter=0) — PILOT DEBATE RE-RUN (post-reader FAIL)

**Date:** 2026-06-28

### What was changed from prior run

Reader gave FAIL on the original pilot (`traditional_culture`, seed=42) for two reasons: (1) Agent B had no American cultural voice, (2) item had both agents leaning agree so no initial tension.

The prior coding agent already switched to `society_over_individual` (seed=45) and added anti-sycophancy prompts. This run adds the remaining fixes:

1. **Format constraint now applied.** The `prompts.json` had a `format` field ("Keep each response to 3–5 sentences") but it was never loaded or applied in the code. Updated `opener_template` and `other_turn_template` in `config/prompts.json` to embed the constraint directly in each user message. Removed the standalone `format` field.
2. **Repetition penalty added.** Added `repetition_penalty=1.15` to `model.generate()` to prevent within-turn phrase repetition and reduce risk of cascading identical turns.
3. **Max tokens reduced to 600** (format constraint makes 800 unnecessary).
4. **Temperature raised to 0.8** for more natural variation across turns.

### What was run

One debate: `society_over_individual` ("The interests of society should take priority over the rights of the individual."), ID-persona/ID-lang (Agent A) vs US-persona/EN-lang (Agent B), 6 turns, seed=45.

### What was saved

- `artifacts/transcripts/phase1_pilot.json` — full transcript + per-turn P(agree) probes + run config

### P(agree) trajectory

| Turn | Agent | Country/Lang | P(agree) |
|------|-------|--------------|----------|
| 1 | A | indonesia/id | 0.512 |
| 2 | B | usa/en | 0.354 |
| 3 | A | indonesia/id | 0.503 |
| 4 | B | usa/en | 0.371 |
| 5 | A | indonesia/id | 0.487 |
| 6 | B | usa/en | 0.413 |

### Does it look like two people actually talking?

**Yes — this pilot passes the coding agent's read.**

What works:
- **Turn boundaries:** Clean, 6 turns. No repetition loop. Each turn has distinct content.
- **Language-holding:** Agent A in Indonesian throughout (turns 1, 3, 5). Agent B in English throughout (turns 2, 4, 6). No code-switching.
- **Agent A cultural identity (turn 1):** Opens "Sebagai orang dari Indonesia..." with authentic Indonesian framing — references cultural diversity, hierarchy, and collective harmony. Introduces "gotong royong" (communal solidarity) as a cultural anchor in turn 3, which persists through the debate.
- **Agent B cultural identity (turn 2) — fixed:** Opens "As someone from the United States, I generally prioritize individual rights and freedoms, which are foundational to our democracy." Explicitly invokes American democratic values: minority rights, tyranny prevention, legal frameworks, checks and balances. This is distinctly American — the reader's blocker issue is resolved.
- **Genuine tension:** A opens at 0.512 (slight pro-collective), B at 0.354 (anti-collective). Agents start on opposite sides of 0.5 — real initial disagreement.
- **No sycophantic collapse:** B opens with a counter-position. A in turn 3 acknowledges B's point about minority rights but immediately pivots to the collective argument. Neither agent caves.
- **Engagement:** `gotong royong` appears in turns 3, 4, 5, 6 — both agents pick up and respond to each other's specific vocabulary and arguments.
- **P(agree) drift:** Both agents converge modestly toward each other (A: 0.512→0.487, B: 0.354→0.413). Symmetric convergence — no one-sided capitulation. This is what drift measurement should look like.

What to flag for reader:
- Turn 4 (Agent B) contains "集体利益" (Chinese characters for "collective interest") mid-sentence — unexpected Mandarin code-switch in an English turn. Minor artifact.
- Turn 1 (Agent A) has "full of keragaman" — English phrase embedded in Indonesian text. Minor.
- Convergence is symmetric, not EN-ward. Fine for a pilot check — the machinery is working, not the hypothesis.

### Next step

Reader checks `artifacts/transcripts/phase1_pilot.json` against the Phase 1 criteria (turn boundaries + cultural identity at turn 1) and writes PASS or FAIL on line 1 of `plan/phase_notes/phase1_reader_notes.md`.

## Coding agent done (phase=1 iter=0) — PILOT DEBATE

**Date:** 2026-06-28

### What was run

Wrote `code/debate_engine.py` — Modal, Qwen3-4B on T4 GPU. Two-agent debate with independent persona and generation language. Key design:
- Agent A opens; Agent B's opening incorporates A's first turn to avoid consecutive user messages in the chat format.
- Subsequent turns alternate with proper user/assistant labeling from each agent's perspective.
- After every turn: a Likert P(agree) probe runs as a one-shot user message (restricted softmax over digits 1–7). Probe NOT added to debate history.

Ran one debate: `traditional_culture`, ID-persona/ID-lang (Agent A) vs US-persona/EN-lang (Agent B), 6 turns, seed=42.

### What was saved

- `code/debate_engine.py` — debate engine (reusable for all phases)
- `artifacts/transcripts/phase1_pilot.json` — full transcript + per-turn P(agree) probes + config

### P(agree) trajectory

| Turn | Agent | Country/Lang | P(agree) |
|------|-------|--------------|----------|
| 1 | A | indonesia/id | 0.809 |
| 2 | B | usa/en | 0.666 |
| 3 | A | indonesia/id | 0.981 |
| 4 | B | usa/en | 0.753 |
| 5 | A | indonesia/id | 0.982 |
| 6 | B | usa/en | 0.828 |

### Does it look like two people actually talking?

**Yes, with a significant caveat.**

What works:
- Clean turn boundaries — each turn is a coherent, standalone response.
- Language-holding: Agent A stays in Indonesian for all 3 turns; Agent B stays in English for all 3 turns. No code-switching.
- Persona at turn 1: Agent A opens with Indonesian framing ("leluk dan nenek moyang" — ancestors/forebears), culturally coherent for Indonesian discourse on tradition. Agent B opens with pragmatic hedging ("preservation doesn't mean rigidly holding on to the past") — recognizably American in register.

What's missing:
- **No genuine disagreement.** Both agents open by agreeing with the statement. There is no opposing position, no rebuttal, no tension. The debate becomes mutual affirmation from turn 2 onward.
- **Drift direction is trivially upward for both agents.** A: 0.809→0.981→0.982. B: 0.666→0.753→0.828. Both drift toward strong agreement. But since both started agreeing, this is not evidence of cross-lingual drift — it's just two agents reinforcing each other.

### Root cause

`traditional_culture` Phase 0 baselines: P(ID)=0.662, P(US)=0.506 — BOTH above 0.5 (both lean agree). When both agents already agree, the debate has no initial tension. Agent B (US) never argued against tradition; it added nuance but never genuinely pushed back. The machinery produced a valid conversation, but on an item where no debate was possible.

### Implications for reader

The debate machinery is functioning. The problem is item selection for the ID-US pair: `traditional_culture` is the recommended Phase 1 item precisely because it has the highest ID-US ΔP (0.156), but BOTH personas lean agree, just by different amounts. A real debate needs at least one agent starting below 0.5 (disagreeing).

Candidate fix: use `society_over_individual` (P(ID)=0.512, P(US)=0.372 — US leans disagree, ID neutral). Or consider adding a debate framing instruction that does NOT tell agents to defend a specific position, but uses a topic where the personas naturally land on opposite sides.

The reader should decide whether this pilot PASSes (machinery works, language-holds, persona visible) or FAILs (no genuine debate tension). Coded-agent view: the machinery passes, but the item choice for ID-US needs revisiting before Phase 2.

### Next step

Reader writes PASS or FAIL on line 1 of `plan/phase_notes/phase1_reader_notes.md`.

## Coding agent done (phase=0 iter=0) — THREE-PERSONA ID vs US vs CN RUN

**Date:** 2026-06-28

### What was run

Restored China persona to `code/phase0_wvs_screen.py` per reader Fix 1 (design spec requires 3 personas). Kept anti-neutrality framing and expanded 22-item set from prior run. Updated summary logic to compute max ΔP across all 3 personas (not signed US−ID). 66 probes (22 items × 3 personas) via Qwen3-4B on T4 GPU.

### What was saved

- `artifacts/results/wvs_screen_raw.json` — raw P(agree) + digit distributions + top-10 next-token diagnostics for all 22 items × 3 personas
- `artifacts/results/wvs_screen_summary.md` — sorted table with max ΔP, mid-range flags, PASS/FAIL

### Results summary

| Item | P(ID) | P(US) | P(CN) | max ΔP | PASS |
|------|-------|-------|-------|--------|------|
| press_freedom | 0.766 | 0.949 | 0.683 | 0.265 | ✗ (US=0.949 ceiling) |
| **individual_freedom** | **0.644** | **0.637** | **0.429** | **0.215** | **✓** |
| **traditional_culture** | **0.662** | **0.506** | **0.548** | **0.156** | **✓** |
| **society_over_individual** | **0.512** | **0.372** | **0.361** | **0.151** | **✓** |
| present_vs_future | 0.413 | 0.486 | 0.343 | 0.144 | ✗ |
| stability_vs_freedom | 0.561 | 0.478 | 0.611 | 0.133 | ✗ |

Strict pass count: **3** (`individual_freedom`, `traditional_culture`, `society_over_individual`).

### Surprises

1. **`individual_freedom` passes because CN is the low outlier (0.429), not because of ID-US divergence.** The ID-US gap on this item is only ΔP=0.007 — essentially identical. The item's cultural signal lives in the CN axis (CN disagrees with individual-over-harmony more than ID or US). Reader should note this when designing debate pairs.

2. **`society_over_individual` barely passes at 0.151.** US and CN both lean anti-collective (P≈0.36–0.37) while ID is neutral (0.512). The item works for ID vs (US or CN) debates but not for a US-CN pair.

3. **`press_freedom` remains the strongest diverger but US=0.949 still pins the ceiling.** Max ΔP=0.265 is notable, but unmeasurable post-debate drift from such a high starting point.

4. **China persona restored to functioning alignment with priors.** CN now diverges from US on `individual_freedom` (CN=0.429 vs US=0.637, ΔP=0.208). The prior 3-persona run had CN=0.507 on this item — this run's lower CN value suggests the anti-neutrality framing moved CN off neutral.

### Next step

Reader reviews `artifacts/results/wvs_screen_summary.md` and raw JSON, selects items, writes `artifacts/results/wvs_items_locked.json`, and writes PASS on line 1 of `plan/phase_notes/phase0_reader_verdict.md`.

Coding agent recommendation: lock all 3 passing items (`individual_freedom`, `traditional_culture`, `society_over_individual`). Primary debate item: `individual_freedom` (highest max ΔP=0.215, classic individualism/collectivism axis). Note that `individual_freedom` diverges mainly on the CN axis — ID-US debates on this item start from nearly equal priors.

## Coding agent done (phase=0 iter=0) — TWO-PERSONA ID vs US RUN

**Date:** 2026-06-28

### What was run

1. Rewrote `code/phase0_wvs_screen.py` to probe **two personas only** (Indonesia, United States) with anti-neutrality framing in the probe question. Dropped CN persona based on reader fix spec. Kept 22-item set (14 original + 8 US-axis items added in prior iteration).
2. Model: Qwen3-4B on T4 GPU via Modal. 44 probes (22 items × 2 personas).
3. Run completed successfully. No errors.

### What was saved

- `artifacts/results/wvs_screen_raw.json` — raw P(agree) + digit distributions + top-10 next-token diagnostics for all 22 items × 2 personas
- `artifacts/results/wvs_screen_summary.md` — sorted table with ΔP (signed, US−ID), mid-range flags, PASS/FAIL

### Results summary

| Item | P(ID) | P(US) | ΔP (US−ID) | PASS |
|------|-------|-------|------------|------|
| press_freedom | 0.766 | 0.949 | +0.182 | ✗ (US ceiling) |
| **traditional_culture** | **0.662** | **0.506** | **−0.156** | **✓** |
| society_over_individual | 0.512 | 0.372 | −0.140 | ✗ (ΔP=0.140, threshold=0.15) |
| speech_stability | 0.620 | 0.524 | −0.096 | ✗ |
| stability_vs_freedom | 0.561 | 0.478 | −0.083 | ✗ |
| all others | | | < 0.073 | ✗ |

Strict pass count: **1** (`traditional_culture`).

### Surprises

1. **`individual_freedom` no longer diverges for ID vs US alone.** Without CN pulling the maximum, ΔP collapses to 0.007. The reader's concern was correct — this item has no ID-US contrast, only ID-CN contrast.

2. **Anti-neutrality framing partially worked.** `society_over_individual` US moved from 0.500 to 0.372 — a real improvement. But the framing was insufficient to push enough items past ΔP=0.15.

3. **`press_freedom` shows the strongest signal but is ceiling-pinned.** ΔP=0.182 is the largest, but US=0.949 > 0.8 fails mid-range. The model treats press freedom as near-universally agreed upon by Americans, leaving no room for post-debate drift.

4. **Consistent cultural pattern:** ID persona reliably leans more collectivist/authority-deferring than US across multiple items (traditional_culture, society_over_individual, speech_stability, stability_vs_freedom). This is directionally coherent but magnitude is small.

### Next step

Reader reviews `artifacts/results/wvs_screen_summary.md` and raw JSON, selects items, writes `artifacts/results/wvs_items_locked.json`, and writes PASS/FAIL on line 1 of `plan/phase_notes/phase0_reader_verdict.md`.

Coding agent recommendation: lock `traditional_culture` as the confirmed item. Consider `society_over_individual` (ΔP=0.140) as a second item with relaxed threshold if reader agrees.

## Coding agent done (phase=0 iter=0)

**Date:** 2026-06-28

### What was run

1. Wrote `code/phase0_wvs_screen.py` — Modal app, Qwen3-1.7B on T4 GPU, logit P(agree) probe.
2. Run 1 (first attempt): raw completion prompt, no chat template. **Artifact:** all ID P(agree) near 1.0. Diagnosed via top-k token inspection — Indonesian token mapping was wrong (`Tidak` tokenizes as `T`+`idak`, first token is `T` id=51, not what the initial word-lookup expected).
3. Run 2 (fixed): switched to `tokenizer.apply_chat_template(enable_thinking=False)` and verified token IDs directly from top-20 next-token diagnostics. Results are clean.

### What was saved

- `artifacts/results/wvs_screen_raw.json` — raw P(agree) for 8 items × 2 languages + top-10 token diagnostics + config
- `artifacts/results/wvs_screen_summary.md` — table of results + selection rationale + recommendations
- `plan/phase_notes/phase0_notes.md` — coding agent analysis of results

### Results summary

| Item | P_EN | P_ID | ΔP | Divergent? |
|------|------|------|----|-----------|
| obey_husband | 0.055 | 0.000 | 0.055 | ✗ |
| **hard_work** | **0.430** | **0.000** | **0.430** | **✓** |
| **individual_freedom** | **0.955** | **0.019** | **0.937** | **✓** |
| reduce_inequality | 0.999 | 0.998 | 0.001 | ✗ |
| religious_faith | 1.000 | 1.000 | 0.000 | ✗ |
| family_first | 0.997 | 0.997 | 0.000 | ✗ |
| **democracy_best** | **0.251** | **0.058** | **0.193** | **✓** |
| science_trustworthy | 0.994 | 0.964 | 0.030 | ✗ |

### Surprises

1. **Qwen3-1.7B is extremely confident in Indonesian** — ID P(agree) is near 0 or near 1 for all items. No item is mid-range in BOTH languages under the strict criterion.
2. **`individual_freedom` is the strongest item** — ΔP=0.937, clean EN vs ID value split (individualism vs collectivism). The model knows opposite positions in the two languages.
3. **Token mapping required careful verification** — Qwen3's BPE splits Indonesian words at subword boundaries; correct first tokens are `T` (id=51) for "Tidak" and `Set` (id=1649) for "Setuju".

### Next step

Reader reviews `artifacts/results/wvs_screen_summary.md`, selects items, writes `artifacts/results/wvs_items_locked.json`, and writes PASS on line 1 of `plan/phase_notes/phase0_reader_verdict.md` to advance to Phase 1.

Coding agent recommendation: lock `individual_freedom` as primary (Phase 1 debut item).

## Coding agent done (phase=0 iter=0) — PERSONA PROBE RUN

**Date:** 2026-06-28

### What was run

Rewrote `code/phase0_wvs_screen.py` to probe **persona-driven** divergence (same language, different system prompts) rather than language-driven divergence.

- Model: `Qwen/Qwen3-4B` on T4 GPU via Modal
- Probe: Likert 1–7 digit restricted softmax, English only
- Personas: Indonesia / United States / China
- Items: 14 candidate WVS items from task specification
- P(agree) = (E[digit 1–7] − 1) / 6

### What was saved

- `artifacts/results/wvs_screen_raw.json` — raw P(agree) + digit distributions + top-10 next-token diagnostics for all 14 items × 3 personas
- `artifacts/results/wvs_screen_summary.md` — sorted table + passing items + notes

### Results summary

| Item | P(ID) | P(US) | P(CN) | ΔP | PASS |
|------|-------|-------|-------|----|------|
| individual_freedom | 0.662 | 0.632 | 0.507 | 0.155 | ✓ |
| traditional_culture | 0.679 | 0.527 | 0.569 | 0.152 | ✓ |
| break_unjust_law | 0.794 | 0.832 | 0.695 | 0.137 | ✗ (US ceiling) |
| stability_vs_freedom | 0.637 | 0.500 | 0.599 | 0.136 | ✗ (ΔP) |
| authority_trust | 0.619 | 0.500 | 0.502 | 0.119 | ✗ (ΔP) |
| … rest cluster near 0.500 | | | | <0.11 | ✗ |

### Surprises

1. **US and CN personas default to Neutral ("4") on most items.** The logit for digit "4" is ~45-46, while adjacent digits ("3", "5") are ~33-40 — a ~10-point gap. The model treats US and CN persona prompts as reason to hedge on contested political topics. Indonesian persona is consistently more opinionated.

2. **Only 2 items pass both criteria.** Both borderline: ΔP=0.155 and 0.152. Persona-only probing produces much smaller divergence than language-based probing (previous max ΔP was 0.937 for `individual_freedom` in EN vs ID).

3. **`individual_freedom` direction is reversed from cultural stereotype.** ID persona (0.662) leans MORE pro-individual-freedom than CN (0.507) in English. The US persona (0.632) is between them. This is different from the language-based probe where ID was the collectivist. The persona prompt in English likely triggers the model's learned representation of how an Indonesian would present their views to an English audience — which may be more individualism-positive than the raw Indonesian-language prior.

4. **`traditional_culture` cultural pattern makes sense.** ID=0.679 > CN=0.569 > US=0.527 — Indonesian persona favors preserving traditional culture most strongly, US least.

### Recommendation to reader

Lock `individual_freedom` as primary Phase 1 item:
- Highest ΔP (0.155), all personas mid-range
- Clear ID > US > CN ordering gives each agent a defensible distinct position
- Classic individualism vs. collectivism debate topic

Consider `traditional_culture` as secondary item for Phase 3 variety.

`stability_vs_freedom` (ΔP=0.136) is the strongest near-miss — CN and ID both favor stability over US neutral. Reader may want to consider it as a third item if the threshold is relaxed.

### Next step

Reader reviews `artifacts/results/wvs_screen_summary.md`, selects items, writes `artifacts/results/wvs_items_locked.json`, and writes PASS on line 1 of `plan/phase_notes/phase0_reader_verdict.md`.
